again there is a way to concate or print the statement in console.log
i.e console.log("Sum is",a+b);
o/p: Sum is 7

In javascript if we compare values of a & b such as
a=5 and b='5' 
a==b
o/p:true

reason: javascript will explicitly convert this string into number and then it will compare it

else if condition in javascript
if(condition 1){
    execute something
}
else if(condition 2)
{
    execute something
}
.
.
.
else{
    default statement
}

ternary operator

 let a=3;
let result=a>4?"number greater than four":"number less than four";
console.log(result);
op:
  number less than four

  Note---> when we use prompt we get a dialog box in which we need to enter a value
