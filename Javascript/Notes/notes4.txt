Arrays in javascript 

methods in Arrays
1. push()
2. pop()
3. toString()
4. concat: we can concat more than two array like arr1.concat(arr2,arr3,.....,arr n)------> here order remains the same as in result the elements of arr1 will be printed then arr2 and then arr3
5. unshift()---> this method work as same push() but the elements are added to the beginning
6. shift()---> this method is used to delete the first element from the array
7. slice(startIndex,endIndex) ----> this method is used to extract the part of array with the help of start and end index .This method change the original array
8. splice(startIndex,deleteIndex,newElement) ----> this method delete the element from our given index and then add the new element which we provide
if we dont want to delete any thing from array then we need to keep the count zero for deleteIndex. Changes will be made in the original array
